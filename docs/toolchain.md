# Toolchain

## What goes where

> **mise installs what bootstraps an ecosystem or belongs to none. The
> ecosystem's package manager installs everything else.**

A tool declared in two layers can drift between them — `make check` and
the git hook can then reach different verdicts on the same file, the
exact class of drift this rule prevents. The seam is deliberate: `[tool.uv]`
`python-preference = "only-system"` + `python-downloads = "never"` in
`pyproject.toml` forces uv to use the mise-provided interpreter instead
of shadowing it with its own.

| Tool                                | Where                                       | Why                                                |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
| node, pnpm, python, uv              | `mise.toml`                                 | bootstrap: nothing else can install them           |
| checkmake                           | `mise.toml`                                 | Go binary, no ecosystem in this repo               |
| pre-commit                          | `mise.toml`                                 | meta-tool, outside any single ecosystem            |
| cspell, markdownlint-cli2           | `package.json`                              | Node dev deps, lockfile-managed                    |
| ruff, mypy, pyright, pytest, pylint | `pyproject.toml` `[dependency-groups].dev`  | Python dev deps, `uv.lock`-managed                 |

### Rejected alternatives

- **mise `npm:` / `pipx:` backends** (e.g. `"npm:cspell" = "10"`) —
  resolve at install time with no transitive lockfile, so reproducible
  installs and `--frozen-lockfile` in CI are impossible.
- **pre-commit-managed tool environments** — pre-commit fetches its own
  copies of tools that the ecosystem manager already installs, at
  independently pinned versions; the two layers can drift and reach
  different verdicts on the same file.

## Tools

- **mise** — pins the high-level toolchain (`mise.toml`): Node, pnpm,
  pre-commit, and the language runtime itself (Python, uv). Per-language
  package managers keep doing their own job (uv for Python, pnpm for Node).
- **markdownlint-cli2** + **cspell** (pnpm, dev-only) — Markdown lint and
  spell check.
- **checkmake** — lints the `Makefile` itself (`make makefile-lint`);
  `checkmake.ini` disables the `minphony` rule's `all`/`clean` expectations,
  which don't apply to this Makefile's install/check/fix/test shape.
- **pre-commit** — git hook running the universal checks (whitespace,
  EOF, YAML, TOML, merge-conflict, large-files, line endings) from the
  upstream `pre-commit-hooks`/`checkmake` repos, plus local hooks that
  all shell out to `make` targets (`md-lint`, `spell`, `lint-fix`,
  `format`, `mypy`, `pylint`) so the hook and `make check` can never
  reach a different verdict on the same file.
